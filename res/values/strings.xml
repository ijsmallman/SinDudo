        Liar\'s Dice is a game where you bet on the minimum number of dice of a certain value.
        \n\nEach player has a cup containing at most 6 dice.
        \n\nEach player upturns their cup onto the table and peaks at the values of their own rolled dice.
        \n\nBetting then commences. Full details on the rules can be found at <a>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar\'s_dice</a>.

        Set the value of the slider to the number of dice that are not visible to you on the table.
        \n\nThe graph plots out the probabilities that there will be at least m dice of a given face value in addition to those under your own cup.
        \n\nm can be any number up to the total number of dice that are not visible to you.
        \n\nNote that the probabilities drop of very rapidly.
        \n\nIt is worth baring in mind that you expect one sixth of the unseen dice to have a given face value.
        \n\nThe probability of at least this number of dice is always just over 50%.
